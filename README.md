## Goals
### When I click the generate password button
Then I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
### When prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
### WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
### WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
### WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
### WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
### WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
